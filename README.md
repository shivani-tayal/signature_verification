# signature_verification
Signature is one of the most popular and commonly accepted biometric hallmarks that has been used since the ancient times for verifying different entities related to human beings, viz. documents, forms, bank checks, individuals, etc. Therefore, signature verification is a critical task and many efforts have been made to remove the uncertainty involved in the manual authentication procedure, which makes signature verification an important research line in the field of machine learning and pattern recognition.    In this notebook, we model a writer independent signature verification task with a convolutional Siamese network.
